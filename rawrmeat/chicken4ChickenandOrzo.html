<h2 style="color:brown"> Ingredients </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 1/2 to 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning the chicken</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    <li>2 cups (12 ounces or 340g) orzo pasta</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups chopped onion (about 1 medium onion)</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>3/4 cup canned crushed tomatoes (including juices)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
<h3 style="color:brown"> Recipe </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prep and salt the chicken: Trim the chicken thighs of excess skin and fat. Sprinkle both sides with a little salt.</li>
    <li>Brown the chicken thighs: Heat olive oil and melt butter on medium high heat in a large skillet (large enough to fit all of the chicken pieces) to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot, pat the chicken pieces dry on both sides with paper towels and place skin-side down in the pan. Let cook until the chicken has browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Then turn the chicken pieces over. Let cook until the chicken has browned on that side, about 4 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan, set aside.</li>
    <li>Brown the orzo pasta, then add onions, garlic: Add the orzo pasta to the pan. Stir to coat and let the pasta brown. Once the orzo starts to brown, stir in the chopped onions.</li>
    <li>Stir together the stock, tomatoes, salt, pepper: In a large measuring cup, stir together the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook: Lower the heat to the lowest heat you need to maintain a bare simmer. Cover and let cook until the orzo has completely absorbed the liquid and the chicken is cooked through, about 10 to 12 minutes. Depending on the size of the chicken pieces, it may take longer for the chicken to cook through. Cook the chicken until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken (without hitting the bone) reads 165Â°F. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Taste for salt and pepper and add more if needed. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley to serve.</li>
