  <li>3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

  <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
  <li>2 cups beef stock </li>

<h3 style="color:brown"> Recipe </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Toast and rehydrate the chiles:
Set a kettle or small pot with 3 cups of water over high heat to boil. 

Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 6 chiles de arbol, and all the guajillo and ancho chiles, and toast them for 1 to 2 minutes. The remaining 4 chiles de arbol will be used to garnish the birria. The chiles are ready when you can smell them.

Transfer the toasted chiles into a medium bowl and cover with the boiled water. Soak them for 20 minutes, until they turn nice and soft.</li>
    <li>Char the vegetables: 
Heat the same skillet used to toast the chiles over medium-high heat. Add the tomatoes, onion, and garlic. You don’t need to add any oil. Lightly char them all around, stirring occasionally. This will take you 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Blend the red chile sauce: 
Transfer the rehydrated chiles and the soaking water, the charred vegetables, cumin, oregano, peppercorns, salt, and vinegar into a blender. Blend until you get a bright red smooth sauce. This is the flavor base for your consomé.

</li>
    <li>Make the birria: 
In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, add the olive oil and heat it over high heat. Carefully add the red chile sauce and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. 

Stir in the beef, bay leaves, beef stock, and water. Bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Prepare the garnishes: 
You’ll have three small bowls with garnishes: One with the finely chopped onion and cilantro mixed together. Use your hands to roughly crumble the remaining 4 chiles de arbol into a separate small bowl.  And the last bowl will hold the lime wedges.</li>
    <li>Shred the beef: 
Remove the pot away from the heat. With a slotted spoon, transfer the meat into a large bowl. With the help of two forks, shred the meat and return it to the pot. Taste your birria and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper, if needed.</li>
    <li>Serve:
Serve warm in a bowl, garnished with the onions and cilantro, crushed chiles de arbol, and a good squeeze of lime. Enjoy and turn leftovers into birria tacos! 

Refrigerate leftovers in a lidded container for 1 week and in the freezer for up to 1 month. To reheat, defrost it overnight in the fridge and warm it up in a saucepan on the stove top with a splash of beef stock or water.</li>
