<h2 style="color:brown"> Ingredients </h2>
  <ul>
  <li>1 pound pork belly</li>
  <li>1 clove garlic, sliced thin</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha</li>
  <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
  <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>Pinch of salt and pepper</li>
  <li>Sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
<h3 style="color:brown"> Recipe </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin heating the water:
Fill a pot with water and place your immersion circulator inside. Set the temperature to 158°F for steak-like bites or 170°F for very tender, melt-in-your-mouth bites, and let the water come up to temperature.</li>
      <li>Combine the ingredients and seal the bag:
Add pork belly to a freezer safe gallon sized plastic bag along with slivered garlic, soy sauce, and sriracha.

Seal the bag with as little air as possible by using water-displacement method: Just slowly lower the bag with the pork belly into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air out through the top of the bag. Once the top of the bag reaches the water line and all the air has been pressed out, seal the bag. (Read more here.)

You can do this in the pot of water as it heats. (Just be careful if the water is already steaming!)

Set the pork belly aside on a kitchen towel until the water has finished heating.</li>
        <li>Cook the pork belly sous vide:
Once the water has come to temperature, submerge the sealed bag of pork belly. Make sure the pork belly is completely submerged so the food cooks evenly

Cook for 12 hours – cover the pot with foil or plastic wrap to slow evaporation and add more water if the water level becomes low. When cooking time ends, remove from the water and turn off the circulator.</li>
     <li>Chill the pork belly:
This will take at least an hour in the fridge, though at this point the pork belly can also be refrigerated for up to three days before serving. It should be cooled completely and the fat should be congealed in the bag for easier trimming.</li>
     <li>Trim the pork belly:
Remove the chilled pork belly from bag and trim off any over-hanging fatty pieces and thin pieces so you have a clean rectangle of pork belly that's evenly thick.</li>
     <li>Slice the pork belly into bites:
Slice belly into strips about 1/2 inch thick, and then into bite-sized pieces about 1 1/2 inches long. Skewer the pork belly bites through rind, going top to bottom, so the sides with the largest surface area will be in contact with the grill.</li>
     <li>Heat the grill:
Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to high heat. (About 500°F or until you can hold your hand 1 inch over the grates for 1 to 2 seconds.) Clean the grates of the grill very well and use tongs to rub them with an oil-soaked paper towel.

Meanwhile, mix glaze together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Grill the bites:
Lay the pork belly bites on the grill over direct heat and brush with glaze. Close the grill lid and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on a gas grill (1 to 2 minutes on charcoal), or until you see crispy seared marks on the underside.

Flip, brush with more glaze, and grill another 2 to 3 minutes (or 1 to 2 minutes on charcoal). Remove from the grill to a platter and brush lightly with more glaze.</li>
    <li>Serve:
Sprinkle the pork belly bites with sesame seeds and serve with toothpicks while warm.</li>
