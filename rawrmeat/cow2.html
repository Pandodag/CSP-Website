    <li>2 medium parsnips, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>4 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>1 pound new potatoes, halved</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, quartered</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>

<h3 style="color:brown"> Recipe </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Brown the beef: In a medium bowl, add the beef, flour, salt, and black pepper. Toss to coat the beef evenly with the flour. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil. Once oil is hot (rippling, but not smoking), add half of the beef and sear for 3 to 4 minutes without stirring it. Flip the beef over and brown the other side, for 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the seared beef into a bowl. Sear the remaining beef and transfer them into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Deglaze the skillet: Turn heat down to medium-low and add the onions. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently, to soften them slightly. Add the red wine. Use a wooden spatula to scrape up any brown bits stuck to the skillet.</li>
    <li>Cook the stew in the slow cooker: In a large slow cooker, add the celery, parsnips, carrots, potatoes, garlic, bay leaves, and beef stock. Add the browned beef and the onions and red wine from the skillet. Cover and cook on high for 5 to 6 hours or on low for 8 hours.</li>
    <li>Thicken the stew: The stew is cooked when the meat is fall-apart tender if you grab a piece with a fork. The vegetables will be cooked through and very tender as well. Taste and season the stew to your liking. It might need a pinch of salt and black pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water and stir it into the stew to thicken it slightly. It should thicken after 1 to 2 minutes of stirring.</li>
    <li>Serve the stew: Ladle the beef stew into bowls and garnish them with the parsley. This stew keeps and freezes fantastically. Keep it in the fridge for up to 5 days or transfer it to a freezer-safe container and freeze it for up to 3 months. Reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of water for best results.</li>
