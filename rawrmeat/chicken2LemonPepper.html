<h2 style="color:brown"> Ingredients </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 large chicken breasts)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons lemon pepper seasoning, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced or grated</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
    <li>1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 2 lemons)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Italian parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>Lemon slices, for garnish (optional)</li>
<h3 style="color:brown"> Recipe </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cut the chicken breast into cutlets: Place the palm of your hand flat against the top of a whole chicken breast to keep it from sliding around. With the broad side of your knife horizontal to the cutting board, cut through the chicken breast to create 2 thinner halves (cutlets).</li>
    <li>Season, then dredge the chicken breasts: In a small bowl, combine 4 teaspoons of the lemon pepper seasoning and the salt. Add the flour to a separate shallow dish. Season both sides of each of the chicken breasts with the spice mixture. Dredge both sides of the seasoned chicken in the flour, shaking off any excess flour, then lay the dredged chicken on a wire rack or platter while you heat the pan.</li>
    <li>Pan-fry the chicken: In a large skillet, heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, swirl the pan a little to combine the two fats. Once the oil in the skillet begins to shimmer, lay your chicken cutlets in a single layer in the pan. You may need to fry in batches. Fry the chicken for 3 minutes without moving. Use a pair of tongs to flip the chicken and fry until they’re cooked through, an additional 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Use your tongs to remove the chicken from the skillet to a platter.</li>
    <li>Make the lemon pepper sauce: Discard the darkened fat from the skillet. Return the skillet to the stove and add the remaining butter. Melt the butter in the pan over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the garlic. Sauté the garlic in the butter until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add the chicken stock and lemon juice and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow the liquid in the skillet to come to a boil and continue to boil until very slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Season the sauce with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of lemon pepper seasoning and salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Coat the chicken: Once the sauce has reduced slightly, return the chicken breasts to the pan. Turn them over to coat both sides in the sauce and turn the stove off. Allow the residual heat from the pan to warm the chicken up before sprinkling the chopped parsley over top. Garnish with lemon slices and serve. </li>
