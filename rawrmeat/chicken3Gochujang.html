    <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    <li>2 cups (12 ounces or 340g) orzo pasta</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups chopped onion (about 1 medium onion)</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups chicken stock</li>

<h3 style="color:brown"> Recipe </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prep and salt the chicken: Trim the chicken thighs of excess skin and fat. Sprinkle both sides with a little salt.</li>
    <li>Brown the chicken thighs: Heat olive oil and melt butter on medium high heat in a large skillet (large enough to fit all of the chicken pieces) to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot, pat the chicken pieces dry on both sides with paper towels and place skin-side down in the pan. Let cook until the chicken has browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Then turn the chicken pieces over. Let cook until the chicken has browned on that side, about 4 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan, set aside.</li>
    <li>Brown the orzo pasta, then add onions, garlic: Add the orzo pasta to the pan. Stir to coat and let the pasta brown. Once the orzo starts to brown, stir in the chopped onions.</li>
    <li>Stir together the stock, tomatoes, salt, pepper: In a large measuring cup, stir together the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
    <li>Add back the chicken, and pour stock mixture over orzo: Place the chicken pieces skin-side up, on top of the orzo.</li>
    <li>Garnish and serve: Garnish with chopped chives and toasted sesame seeds. Serve. Place chicken in an airtight container no longer than 2 hours after cooking. The leftovers will keep for 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.</li>
